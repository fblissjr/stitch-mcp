# stitch-mcp Documentation

stitch-mcp is a CLI for moving AI-generated UI designs from Google's Stitch platform into your development workflow. It previews designs locally, builds sites from them, and feeds design context to coding agents through an MCP proxy.

## Reading paths

Pick the path that matches what you're trying to do:

**Quick start with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or Antigravity**
1. [Getting Started tutorial](getting-started.md) -- walks through proxy setup, auth, and first tool calls

**Give your coding agent design context**
1. [Set up authentication](setup.md)
2. [Connect your agent](connect-your-agent.md)
3. [Use Stitch tools in agents](use-stitch-tools-in-agents.md)

**Build agent skills with Stitch data**
1. [Set up authentication](setup.md)
2. [Connect your agent](connect-your-agent.md)
3. [Use Stitch tools in agents](use-stitch-tools-in-agents.md)
4. [Understand Agent Skills](agent-skills.md)
5. [Build an Agent Skill](build-agent-skills.md)

**Preview and build from designs locally**
1. [Set up authentication](setup.md)
2. [Preview designs](preview-designs.md)
3. [Build a site](build-a-site.md)

**Extend Stitch with custom tools**
1. [Tool Catalog](tool-catalog.md) — see what's built in
2. [Virtual Tools reference](virtual-tools.md)
3. [Build a Virtual Tool](build-virtual-tools.md)
